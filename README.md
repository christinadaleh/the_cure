# the_cure

Basic video game written in Java Final project for ENGR1110 (Introduction to Software Engineering) - 
my first experience with programming.

The game has 4 major objects: the player, the zombies, the parts to the cure, and the boss. 
The point of the game is to kill the enemies that are in your way of retrieving parts of the cure, 
and then kill the boss to end the game.

Because it was my first class to ever write code, the game is very basic. 
We worked as a team and developed the game over the last half of the semester. 
There are many gliches, but it was my first game!
